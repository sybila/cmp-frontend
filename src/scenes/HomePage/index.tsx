            CMP is a general framework for public sharing, annotation, and
            visualisation of domain-specific dynamical models and wet-lab
            experiments.
          </p>
          <p>
            The platform is unique in integrating abstract mathematical models
            with a precise consortium-agreed bio-chemical description provided
            in a rule-based formalism. The general aim is to stimulate
            collaboration between experimental and computational systems
            biologists to achieve a better understanding of the domain-specific
            system.
          </p>
          <p>
            CMP is logically divided into 4 parts. Each of them has a specific
            responsibility and works with a different database. Modules
            communicate with each other in specific ways concerning their
            competence defined by their functionalities.
